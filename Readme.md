# nBlog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imoore/nBlog.png)](https://travis-ci.org/imoore/nBlog)

nBlog is my first attempt to make node.js with mongodb and express blog and content management system

**Note**: This is currently in *beta* status, meaning that we can make
changes in the future that *may not be compatible* with the previous versions.
